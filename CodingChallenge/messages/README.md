Hello and welcome to the Seam programming challenge. Follow the instructions below to get your solution

- Prerequisites:

You'll need to install maven to complete the task.

- Steps:

The program in this challenge is a very simple messaging system. There is a database of messages and if we give a particular
subscriber id it should give the latest message and first unread message of that particular subscriber.


To run the program there is 1 input you need: the subscriber id

Run the program and give the subscriber id as '9020be9e-958a-4536-8164-4a8bbc17c3da'

- Task: fix the bugs!

But wait! There are some bugs in the program that you'll need to fix first. Once you've fixed them the program will display
some output like this:

{
  "senderId":"9020be9e-958a-4536-8164-4a8bbc17c3da",
  "body":"Nothing as such",
  "createdAt":"2018-06-18 15:02:54.786+0530",
  "readAt":{
    "e8549d50-31ec-451d-a9ba-44e13549ddb1":"0"
  }
}


There are also comments in the code that you'll need to read to understand what it's trying to do. Then look closely at the
code and make sure it is doing what the comments say.

Try to follow the best coding practices and also write unit test cases covering all the edge cases.

Happy Coding!!!
